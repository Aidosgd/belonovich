                  <p>Chocolife is the largest discount coupon service in Kazakhstan. They provide coupons for all types of goods and services.</p>
                  <div class="hidden-block">
                    <div class="desc">Process</div>
                    <p>I worked on Chocolife with the project manager. At that time mobile apps were new in Kazakhstan market and there wasn’t such definition as UX design. Solutions were based on our own experience and colleagues’ survey and competitor analysis. We prepared a mind map of web site structure, made prototype, drew design and tested hypotheses among colleagues. Work was done in coordination within team and client.</p>

                    <div class="desc">Problems and solutions</div>
                    <p>There was a problem in viewing current promotions. Some users preferred to see pictures of promotions (like a card), and some to see them in a list. We decided to give a user a choice and made the list version default with option to switch to the card version with pictures.</p>

                    <div class="desc">Result</div>
                    <p>After the production, we received a lot of positive feedback from users in the App store and Play Market. They noted the convenience of the app. Certainly, the application required improvements, but the client decided to maintain project inside and we hadn’t chance to improve it. Only in 2017 year they launch the second version of the app. </p>
                    <p>Chocolife was the first major app for me.  That year after the release it was downloaded 11 000 times for Android only (now between 500,000 - 1,000,000 install), it is excellent result for our market.</p>

                    <p>This area is specific, it took a lot of time to investigate and understand it. As a result, we spent a week at the client's office, analyzing the information with him. We carefully studied the stock exchanges of other countries, conducted a survey among the target audience and examined the needs and concerns of each target group. We analyzed the scenarios of each of them.</p>

                    <p>We had serious problems with the prototype, because the client changed the data (content) on pages a lot of times, this leaded modification of pages and back-end.  The data changed because of their internal disputes and the company's vague strategy. In the end, we secured the approval of prototype, after a general meeting with management and we no longer had to experiment with the design content.</p>
                    <p>The approval of the main page took a long time, since the client asked to make glass blocks. We compromised, so the design is different from our original concept. Now I already know how I supposed to convince the client about the irrelevance of the outdated trend.</p>

                    <div class="desc">Work process:</div>
                    <p>From the very beginning, the project was given to another designer. After prototype was approved by client,  I got to continue the work. Goals of the website was clear to me, but customer and business problems were’t. I rejected the approved prototype, because it was raw.</p>
                    <p>I gathered list of questions for clients and received feedback from call-center about clients’ frequently asked question. Benchmarked other insurance websites, got information about which products needed promotions. I was trying to change structure in such a way that users could quickly find the required information. </p>
                    <p>Due to time shortage, I started to make design based on my research. Client wanted to place logo on the center of the header, convinced that it was modern. Understanding his concern I met with him and we together started working on location of logo and came to conclusion that the best spot was on the left side of the header. After that his concern cleared away. </p>
                    <p>Next I gathered all our research to presentation, showed animation of the main page, presented it and got approval to work on other pages. </p>
                    <p>I had to work on close collaboration with fronted developer on website animations.</p>
                    <div class="desc">Problems and solutions: </div>
                    <p>The advantages and benefits of products were not clear to customers and they did not understand the difference between them. Hence, in product list I put main differences between them, so it will be easier to compare and choose the right product. Also the picture of products were added to attract customers to see all the products. </p>
                    <div class="desc">Result: </div>
                    <p>While we do not have information how successfully the tasks were accomplished (web-site is under development), but the design concept was approved in the first attempt. I represented it to the client, having explained the differences as improvements of the prototype.</p>
                    <p>In the debatable cases, I was rearranging the layers in presence of the client. I have explained each decision and its consequences and eventually we achieved a compromise. </p>
                    <p>For me, it was a good experience of protecting my concept for the client and I have implemented the presentation structure with feature explanations for the client in the company's workflow to use in the future. </p>
                    <p>We are planning to add google analytics and set goals to see if our hypotheses were right and what can we change to improve the usability. These steps will be taken in website technical maintenance. </p>

                  <div class="desc">Result: </div>
                  <p>While we do not have information how successfully the tasks were accomplished (web-site is under development), but the design concept was approved in the first attempt. I represented it to the client, having explained the differences as improvements of the prototype.</p>
                  <p>In the debatable cases, I was rearranging the layers in presence of the client. I have explained each decision and its consequences and eventually we achieved a compromise. </p>
                  <p>For me, it was a good experience of protecting my concept for the client and I have implemented the presentation structure with feature explanations for the client in the company's workflow to use in the future. </p>
                  <p>We are planning to add google analytics and set goals to see if our hypotheses were right and what can we change to improve the usability. These steps will be taken in website technical maintenance. </p>
